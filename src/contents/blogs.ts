But the truth is, the Closure is a very simple concept, and once you understand it, you'll discover how powerful and useful it is in your code. In this article, we'll talk about Closure as if we were telling a story. We'll start with very simple examples and without complicated terminology, then dive behind the scenes to see how it actually works and why it's important in our lives as programmers.",

When we called the outer function, the variable `x` was set to 10.\n3. At the moment the inner function was defined, it gained access to `x` (the entire outer environment) and could also modify it.\n4. The outer function then returned the inner function as a value, and was removed from the call stack.\n5. But‚Ä¶ since the inner function still has access to `x`, JavaScript said: ‚ÄúWait, I can‚Äôt delete the outer environment (the place where the variables are stored). Keep it in the heap until the inner function is no longer accessible.‚Äù\n6. So, when we call `fn()` (which is actually the inner function), it retrieves `x` from the outer environment.",
